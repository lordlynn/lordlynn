## üöÄ Check out my other projects on GitHub!
 - The [RAVIR Challenge](https://github.com/lordlynn/RAVIR_Challenge) project served as an introduction to machine learning. This project implemented an autoencoder architecture to segment images of vasculature in the human eye to assist in the mapping of veins and arteries.

 - The [EMG Filtering](https://github.com/lordlynn/EMG_Filtering) project utilized my [thesis](https://github.com/lordlynn/WDA) to record EMG data contaminated with ECG so that an algorithm could be developed to filter out the unwanted signal.

 - The [Smoke Detector](https://github.com/lordlynn/SmokeDetector) project served as a practice project to learn STM microcontrollers and surface mount PCB design.
